    Given an array A consisting of N integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the amount of non-divisors for each element.

    For each number A[i], where 0 â‰¤ i < N, count the number of elements in the array that are not divisors of A[i].

    For example, given array A = [3, 1, 2, 3, 6]:
    - A[0] = 3, non-divisors: 2, 6
    - A[1] = 1, non-divisors: 3, 2, 3, 6

    - A[3] = 3, non-divisors: 2, 6
    - A[4] = 6, no non-divisors

    The function should return [2, 4, 3, 2, 0].
