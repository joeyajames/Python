def solution(K, A):
    """
    Given an integer K and a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the maximum number of ropes of length greater than or equal to K that can be created.

    For each I (0 â‰¤ I < N), the length of rope I on the line is A[I]. Two adjacent ropes can be tied together with a knot, and the length of the tied rope is the sum of lengths of both ropes. The resulting new rope can then be tied again.

    The goal is to tie the ropes in such a way that the number of ropes whose length is greater than or equal to K is maximal.

    For example, given K = 4 and array A such that:
    A[0] = 1
    A[1] = 2
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 4
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 1
    A[6] = 3
    The function should return 3.

    Assumptions:
    - N is an integer within the range [1..100,000]
    - K is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000]
    - Each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000]
