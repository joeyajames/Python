def solution(A):
    """
    Given a non-empty array A consisting of N numbers, returns the absolute distinct count of array A.

    The absolute distinct count is the number of distinct absolute values among the elements of the array.

    For example, given array A such that:
    A[0] = -5
    A[1] = -3
    A[2] = -1
    A[3] =  0
    A[4] =  3
    A[5] =  6
    the function should return 5, as there are 5 distinct absolute values among the elements of this array, namely 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6.

    Assumptions:
    - N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
    - Each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647];
    - Array A is sorted in non-decreasing order.
