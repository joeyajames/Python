    Find the maximum number of flags that can be set on the peaks of the given array.

    Peaks are array elements larger than their neighbors.
    The goal is to set flags on peaks, ensuring that the distance between any two flags is greater than or equal to the number of flags.

    For example, given the array A:
    A = [1, 5, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2]
    The function should return 3, indicating that you can set flags on peaks 1, 5, and 10.

    Assumptions:
    - N is an integer within the range [1..400,000]
    - Each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000,000].
