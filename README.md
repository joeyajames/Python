# Open Source Python Project

Welcome to my open-source Python project! These files are primarily meant to accompany my series of educational YouTube tutorial videos, which you can find on my channel, [Joe James](https://www.youtube.com/user/joejamesusa).

## Purpose

This repository is intended to help individuals learn and improve their Python programming skills through easy-to-understand and reliable source code. I encourage you to use this repository for educational purposes, as well as to download and use any code according to the MIT License.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and follow along with the tutorial videos on my YouTube channel. Feel free to post any comments or questions on my videos, as I am happy to help and engage with my audience.

## Tips for Learning Python

Remember to practice coding on your own and try to create your own algorithms to improve your skills. Learning something about everything and everything about something is the key to becoming a better Python programmer.

## Contact

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me on my YouTube channel or through my website. Happy coding!
