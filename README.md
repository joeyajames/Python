and are mainly intended for training and educational purposes.
You are invited to subscribe to my video channel, and to download and use any code in 
this Python repository, according to the MIT License. 
Feel free to post any comments on my YouTube channel.
i am very happy to see you there on my you tube channel.excited!!!!!!!!!


This source codes are easy to understand and reliable for self study and you will learn them easily, try to practice more coding by making algorithms yourself and you can be better python programmer and remember "Try to learn something about everything and everything about something".

Thank you for reviewing my repositories and keep practising.
