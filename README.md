# What is Python? 
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

Feel free to post any comments on my YouTube channel.
I am very happy to see you there on my you tube channel. excited!!!!!!!!!
## Subscribe to my channel for more tutorial videos. 

This source code is easy to understand and reliable for self study and you will learn them easily, try to practice more coding by making algorithms yourself and you can become a better Python programmer, and remember "Try to learn something about everything and everything about something".

Thank you for reviewing my repositories and keep practicing.
