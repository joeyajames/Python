Formula to calculate compound interest annually is given by:

A = P(1 + R/100) t
Compound Interest = A â€“ P
Where,
A is amount
P is principle amount
R is the rate and
T is the time span

Python3
# Python3 program to find compound 
# interest for given values. 
  
def compound_interest(principle, rate, time): 
  
    # Calculates compound interest  
    Amount = principle * (pow((1 + rate / 100), time)) 
    CI = Amount - principle 
    print("Compound interest is", CI) 
  
# Driver Code  
compound_interest(10000, 10.25, 5
